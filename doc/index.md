# CSim

**CSim** stands for _Component Simulator_ and provides a comprehensive way to implement simulator for microcontroller board and their environment.

Currently, this encompasses:

* An ARMv5T simulator provided by [GLISS](https://sourcesup.renater.fr/projects/gliss2).
* CSIM library that allows to describe a connection network and provide event-driven simulation for performances.
* A simulated component generator also based on [GLISS](https://sourcesup.renater.fr/projects/gliss2).

The following entries provide more details on this:

* [How to define a component?](component.md)
* [How to program in NML?](NMP.md)
